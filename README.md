# Assembly for Beginners
In this repository you will find a beginner's guide to MIPS programming

## Compiling
Assembly files use the ".s" extension

We recommend QtSpim:<br />
https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/

From the top you can find in orange the reset and open option. It is very important that before every compilation you restore the registers and data.<br />
In blue there are the play, pause and stop controls, used to run the program. Followed by the step by step control (in yellow) which will be very useful when debugging.<br />
At the bottom in green are the registers of our processor, they will be filled with whatever you load them with.<br />
And last but not least, in red, the instructions. This is a visual way to know the current instruction, it is very useful with the step by step control in case the program isn't working or has a bug.<br />

You can also use MARS:<br />
