# Assembly for Beginners
In this repository you will find a beginner's guide to MIPS programming

## Compiling
Assembly files use the ".s" extension

We recommend QtSpim:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/

From the top you can find in orange the reset and open option. It is very important that before every compilation you restore the registers and data.
In blue there are the play, pause and stop controls, used to run the program. Followed by the step by step control (in yellow) which will be very useful when debugging.
At the bottom in green are the registers of our processor, they will be filled with whatever you load them with.
And last but not least, in red, the instructions. This is a visual way to know the current instruction, it is very useful with the step by step control in case the program isn't working or has a bug.

You can also use MARS:
